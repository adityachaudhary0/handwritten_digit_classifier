# Handwritten Digit Classifier

A neural network-based handwritten digit classification system built with TensorFlow. This project demonstrates deep learning techniques for recognizing and classifying handwritten digits from images.

## Overview

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow/Keras to classify handwritten digits (0-9) with high accuracy. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset and can predict digits from images with excellent performance.

## Features

- **Neural Network Implementation**: Built with TensorFlow and Keras
- **MNIST Dataset**: Uses the standard MNIST handwritten digit dataset
- **Data Processing**: Includes preprocessing and normalization of image data
- **Model Training**: Comprehensive training pipeline with validation
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluation metrics including accuracy and loss
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive notebook format for easy understanding and experimentation
